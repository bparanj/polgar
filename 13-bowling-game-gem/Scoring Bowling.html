              Score</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
              Score keeping in bowling is as simple as adding up the number of 
              pins that you knock down. As each player takes a turn they try to 
              knock down all ten of the pins. Each player is given up to two opportunities 
              to do this. The player will roll their bowling ball (<a href="http://www.bowling2u.com/shop/default.asp">find 
              a bowling ball</a>) down the bowling alley towards the pins in an 
              attempt to knock pins over. The pins that are knocked down on this 
              first attempt are counted and recorded. The pinsetter at the bowling 
              alley will remove the pins still standing, clear the leveled pins, 
              then return the standing pins back in place. The bowlers ball is 
              returned and the bowler gets a second attempt at knocking the pins 
              over. The bowler again rolls their ball down the alley to try and 
              knock any remaining pins down. The number of pins knocked down on 
              this second attempt is then recorded. The bowlers score is then 
              the pins from the first roll, plus the pins from the second roll, 
              then added to any previous score.</font></p>

              In score keeping a game of bowling each set of ten pins is called 
              a frame and an entire game has ten frames. The object of each frame 
              in bowling is to knock over all ten pins, and the object of the 
              game is to have a high score. </font></p>

              When a bowler accomplishes the the goal of each frame by knocking 
              over all ten pins they are awarded a bonus. This bonus that is awarded 
              will depend on whether they knocked all ten pins down on their first 
              ball roll or the second roll. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The Strike</b><br>
              When a bowler knocks all ten pins down on the first ball roll they 
              are said to have rolled a strike. The score keeper will mark an 
              X for that frame and the bowlers score is the ten pins that they 
              just knocked down plus they get to add to that what they knock down 
              on their next two ball rolls. Consequently, you may not know what 
              a bowlers score is on that frame for up to two more frames!</font></p>
