s = stub.as_null_object

acts as a UNIX's dev/null equivalent for tests. It ignores any messages. Useful for incidental interactions that is not relevant to what is being tested. It implements the Null Object pattern.

In E-R modeling you have relationships such as 1-n, n-n, 1-1 and so on. In domain modeling you have relationships such as aggregation, composition, inheritance, delegation etc. Most of these have constructs provided by the language or the framework such as Rails. Example: composed_of in Rails, delegate in Ruby, symbol < for inheritance. The interface relationship for roles has to be explicitly specified in the specs to make the relationship between objects explicit.
