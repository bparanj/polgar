1. 

When you try to learn a new library at the same time as you explore the behavior and design of your application, you slow down more than you think.

When you canâ€™t figure out how to make the new library work for this thing you want to build, you might spend hours fighting, debugging, swearing.

Stop. Write a Learning Test.

1. Write a new test.
2. Write a test that checks the things you tried to check earlier with debug statements.
3. Write a test that has nothing to do with your application and its domain.
4. Remove unnecessary details from your test.

When this test passes, then you understand what that part of the library does. If it behaves strangely, then you have the perfect test to send to the maintainers of the library.
