**RSpec Test Structure**

1. 

describe Movie, "Definition. Make sure single responsibility principle is obeyed." do


end

The first argument of the describe block in a spec is name of the class or module under test. It is the subject. It can also be a string. The second is an optional string. It is a good practice to include the second 
string argument that describes the class and make sure that it does not have 'And', 'Or' or 'But'.
If it obeys Single responsibility principle that it will not contain those words.

2.

specify "[Method Under Test] [Scenario] [Expected Behavior]" do
